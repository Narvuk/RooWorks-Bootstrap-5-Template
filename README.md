## Design Highlights

- **Modern, Responsive Layout:**  
  The site is built using Bootstrap, adapting gracefully to all screen sizes—desktop, tablet, and mobile—ensuring accessibility for every user.

- **Custom Branding:**  
  A cohesive visual identity is achieved through carefully selected color palettes, custom iconography (via Bootstrap Icons), and a distinctive logo section.

- **Hero Section with Social Proof:**  
  The homepage greets users with a bold headline, social trust indicators (e.g., “Trusted by 10,000+ Homeowners”, “4.9/5 from 500+ reviews”), and visible calls to action for “Free Estimate” and “Call Now”.

- **Feature Badges:**  
  Quick visual highlights communicate licensing, years of experience, and warranty offerings at a glance.

- **Service Cards:**  
  Service offerings are visually grouped in easy-to-scan cards with clear titles, brief descriptions, feature lists, and action buttons linking to contact forms.

- **Specialty Services:**  
  In addition to the main services, specialty offerings such as Gutter Installation, Ice Dam Prevention, and Skylight Installation are surfaced for added value.

- **Testimonials & Trust Elements:**  
  The site includes dedicated sections for customer reviews, awards, and other credibility-boosting content.
